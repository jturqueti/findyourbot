Final <a href="https://www.ironhack.com/fr/developpement-web/paris">Ironhack</a> project made by <b>Olivier Babiard and Julia Turqueti in 1 week</b>.
<br>We created this as the capstone project for the RNCP (lv.6) degree (French Certification for a Junior Developer). 
<br>ðŸ¤– This first prototype was made in order to create a chatbot's solution comparator, helping companies to find the right solution!
<br>
<br>This first version has been deployed on Heroku: 
<br> ðŸ‘‰ https://findyourbot.herokuapp.com/ (it could take up to 30 seconds to load the page).
<br> ðŸ”¥ Or... <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/024c0676e38144148e70f753ea8cfb7c">Watch 1-minute video for a demo</a>

<b>Our main features:</b>
<ul>
<li>Two sides: clients side and admin side</li>
<li>Search Bar (clients side and admin side)</li>
<li>A survey and filters on the clients side</li>
<li>Leads Generation on the admin side</li>
<li>Full CRUD on the admin side</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b> What we should improve:</b> 
<ul>
<li> We are not DRY! We have a lot of code repetitions ðŸ™ƒ</li>
<li> The CSS part, way too many files! ðŸ¤¯</li>
<li> Update the solutions' informations, they are not correct at the moment ðŸ¤«</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>IronHack requirements for our project:</b>
<ul>
<li> Use React for all of the user-facing parts of your application </li>
<li> Use Express for your API backend that your React app will communicate with </li>
<li> Use Mongoose for models and database communication</li>
<li> Have 3 datamodels or more</li>
<li> Having one for users is a no-brainer</li>
<li> The other two should represent the main functionality of your app</li>
<li> Include sign up, log in & log out functionality with encrypted passwords (or social logins) and authorization (logged in users can do extra things)</li>
<li> Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it</li>
<li> Be deployed online using Heroku, so anybody could use your app</li>
<li> Responsive design is not a requirement</li>
</ul>
